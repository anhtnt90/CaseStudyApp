<h2><a name="monetization">Business and monetization models doctor booking app</a></h2>
<p>How can online doctor app be useful for business?</p>
<p><strong>Increase in profits.</strong></p>
<p>The application for doctor appointment is a new tool for increasing sales and returning visitors. The easier it is for the patient to interact with the booking system of the clinic, the more readily he will come back.</p>
<p><strong>Customer loyalty</strong></p>
<p>Offer your patients a convenient and affordable service to take care of their health, provide individual discounts. Your own application will help you to learn more about users, find out what they need and what they are looking for. Application will allow you to contact your users as well: reminding about upcoming or missing appointments, asking users if they need additional help, or how recovery is going, and much more.</p>
<p><img src="./How to Create a Doctor Appointment App Like Practo, Zocdoc _ mova.io_files/5-3.jpg" alt="doctor app automates staff tasks"></p>
<p><strong>Automating staff</strong></p>
<p>Simple arithmetic: the more entries through the application, the fewer calls to the registry. Of course, there will be conservative patients for whom call is easier, however, administrators will be able to manage easily.</p>
<p><strong>Personal offers</strong></p>
<p>The data from the mobile application will help you to get to know your customers better and offer promotions interesting to them. For example, offer your patients who did not use your services for a long time to be examined by a doctor at a reduced price. It will definetely help you to attract at least half of the non-active patients.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
<p>You can learn about the quality of the work of doctors and clinic staff by collecting feedback through the application. You can quickly correct problems, and patients will be pleased to know that their opinion is important to you.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive advantage</strong></p>
<p>Own mobile application will highlight you among other medical centers and will be another argument in the choice of your clinic.</p>
<p><img src="./How to Create a Doctor Appointment App Like Practo, Zocdoc _ mova.io_files/6-3.jpg" alt="book a doctor appointment"></p>
<p>Usually, doctor appointment app that is made for one particular clinic is available for free. It helps to generate new patients flow, which helps increase profits.</p>
<p>Applications that work as a catalog of different clinics usually use ads to make money. Besides, they can have individual contracts with various clinics. It allows earning money by helping each of them to increase the number of new patients, return existing users, and more.</p>
<p>Another way of monetization is offering in-app payments for rendered services, or in-app store that would help people to buy medications, pay for appointments, and so on.</p>
<p>Some mobile doctor applications generate profits using a paid subscription. For example, each doctor could pay a monthly membership fee. Depending on your business model, you can allow only doctors with paid subscriptions in the app. Or to show premium doctors higher in searches, and help them to find more clients with in-app ads. In this case, doctors will be happy to pay the fee, because it will allow them to increase their client base, and to market their services easier then in offline.</p>
<p>If you are not sure about the correct business strategy, contact mova.io. We worked on many projects, and we understand which model will work best in every individual case. Our highly professional specialists will help you to monetize Android and iOS applications by finding unique solutions for your project.</p>

<h2><a name="estimations">Mobile doctor app estimations</a></h2>
<p>Estimating the costs and timeframes for each particular stage is a difficult task. To do this, we need to be well aware of the final result and be technically savvy in order to estimate the labor costs for each function. Therefore, most experienced specialists are usually involved in this process.<br>
Usually, the app development cost estimate occurs in two stages:</p>
<p><strong>1. Preliminary cost estimate</strong></p>
<p>Although the preliminary estimations are called “rough,” it allows one to know with sufficient accuracy the necessary amount of investments needed to create an application before signing any contracts. That is, you can get it within one day max.</p>
<p><strong>2. The exact price for application development</strong></p>
<p>A more accurate assessment of the cost of developing applications includes estimations for each particular feature: Welcome Screen, Login Screen, Registration, and so on. We calculate how much time is needed for user interface design and development, business logic development, back-end API server, and so on. It helps us to make an extremely precise estimation, that will be used to make a final offer. It is supported by a contract, which fixates the dates and stages of work with a detailed description of the final result.</p>
<p><img src="./How to Create a Doctor Appointment App Like Practo, Zocdoc _ mova.io_files/8-2.jpg" alt="8-2"></p>
<h2><a name="time">How much time does it take to develop an app?</a></h2>
<p>The process of creating a doctor phone app for iOS, Android and other platforms consists of several successive stages. Terms at each stage may be different depending on the complexity of work specifically for each case.</p>
<ul>
<li>Free Estimate (~1 day)</li>
<li>Detailed study of the problem, analysis of the market and competitors (1-3 days)</li>
<li>Prototyping Writing technical specifications (5-15 days)</li>
<li>Design (5-15 days)</li>
<li>Programming (depends on the project, number of features, complexity, and so on)</li>
<li>Testing (just like Programming, this stage depends a lot on project complexity, and is unique to each project)</li>
<li>Deployment</li>
</ul>
<p>On average, doctor appointment application development for one platform (iOS or Android) can take around four months:</p>
<ul>
<li>user interface development: at least ~200 hours</li>
<li>business logic development: at least ~350 hours</li>
<li>back-end development: at least 250 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to make an app for both platforms, it will add an additional 500 hours, depending on the project complexity. With the second platform, we will be able to save much time on reusable parts of the project, such as back-end and admin panel.</p>
<div class="another-article-container" style="border-color: #aaf0ad;">
The last few months were full of a whole set of events related to music services. And if you have an idea to <a href="https://mova.io/blog/doctor-appointment-app/">create a music app</a>, contact us. Our specialists will be happy to develop your project and help you achieve your goals
</div>
<h2><a name="process">Development process</a></h2>
<p>The development of a mobile application from scratch to release takes place on average in 7 basic steps. Some of them are pretty simple and can be done in a couple of days. Others might 3 months, or even more. Some steps can be performed in parallel and some only sequentially.</p>
<p>Below are the stages of the full cycle of mobile apps development from the planning to the release to stores.</p>
<p><strong>Planning</strong></p>
<p>Each project participant must clearly understand the task. To do this, we make a mind map, which clearly demonstrates all the product functions and prototypes, which reflect all the application screens and the transition scheme for them. Depending on our needs, prototypes can be static or interactive.</p>
<p><img src="./How to Create a Doctor Appointment App Like Practo, Zocdoc _ mova.io_files/9-1.jpg" alt="9-1"></p>
<p><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p>After the approval of the prototypes, we take up the design of the application. After all, it is essential that the application is beautiful, functional and contains unique features that distinguish your application from competitors. We carefully draw each screen, taking into account the characteristics of the platform.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile App Development</strong></p>
<p>Directly developing a mobile application consists of three stages. At each stage, the customer is involved in the process in order to judge the status of the project independently and try how it works.</p>
<p>You must select a platform for development. <a href="https://mova.io/services/android/">Android mobile development</a> or <a href="https://mova.io/services/ios/">iOS mobile development</a>, or both.</p>
<p><strong>Server Development (backend)</strong></p>
<p>The back-end is the core of the project. It helps us to save and retrieve the data from the database, authorize users. The back-end is where the core logic of the project lives in. It is essential to write the API and all the accompanying documentation and keep it in good condition.</p>
<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>
<p>Automatic and manual testing on different devices. It is important to pay great attention to the quality of each feature present in the application and to test them under different conditions. Users never use the app in an ideal environment, so we need to see how the app works without internet or on a slow connection. What happens if the user turns off the phone right in the middle of important calculations? Moreover, how the app will work in a “Low Power” mode, or when the battery is almost drained.</p>
<p><strong>Publication to App Store and Play Market</strong></p>
<p><img src="./How to Create a Doctor Appointment App Like Practo, Zocdoc _ mova.io_files/10-1.jpg" alt="Doctor app marketing"></p>
<p><strong>Promotion and Marketing</strong></p>
<p>Marketing is extremely important and often forgotten part of the process. Without users, the project won’t live and obviously won’t generate any revenue. Marketing can be started even before the development itself. You can contact the media, create a website with additional info about the project, begin gathering emails of early adopters, attract people in social media, and listen to their feedback.</p>
<h2><a name="value">Value of medical appointments app as a startup idea</a></h2>
<p>This is a promising direction in functional medicine and pharmacy. Many health care institutions are interested in implementing new technologies. Every year the number of hospitals and private clinics increases, wishing to acquire their own mobile applications, but not everyone is ready to spend a lot of time and money on their development. However, on average, more than $ 2.5 billion is being wasted on outdated ways of interacting with patients. Moreover, we think that many hospitals will benefit a lot from simplifying the process of booking new appointments, acquiring new users, simplifying the procedures of collecting data about user’s treatment, and so on. The mobile application will not only increase profits, but will improve the user’s loyalty, and will help to expand a number of services that the clinic provides.</p>
<p>Applications allow you to systematize all the essential information for the health worker and have unrestricted access to it at any time, and on the patient’s side - to quickly receive adequate assistance and maintain health.</p>
<p>Such a startup idea will help to increase sales and return visits. Besides, it will stand out among competitors and will gain the trust of patients. Reducing the burden on staff and take feedback from users will be additional advantages.</p>

<h2><a name="apps">Popular doctor appointment applications</a></h2>
